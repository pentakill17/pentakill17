## About Me 

Hi my name is Reniel Bunag, I am currently studying and enrolled in BSD, Honours Bachelor of Technology Software Development, and I am on my third year. I have a short history with being involved with coding as I have only taken a liking when I was on my grade 10 of highschool. It was when I was started looking to future careers where I stumbled upon a coding course in highschool, I took it and something clicked that made me want to pursue of being a coder one day! Also, what helped me on my decision was the fact that I enjoy playing videogames in my spare time and my imagination of creating a beautiful game or program is what drives me to my current program. 

I started coding in visual basic where we were instructed to create games, then I learned a little bit of java at my 12th grade and now I am learning C++, web development such as javascript, angular/react, etc.
